* Autoref for closures? https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/21699 (nmatsakis)

# Attending

nmatsakis, brson, pnkfelix, huonw, aturon, steveklabnik, nrc, jack


# Status

* pnkfelix: scoping/drop semantics, placer protocol
* brson: installer, CI
* acrichto: I/O rfcs comments & implementation

# Action Items

# Closure sugar (potentially) expand to a reference based on expected type

https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/21699

```
fn foo(x: &mut FnMut()) {
}

fn foo(x: FnMut()) { ... } // not currently legal
```

```
foo(&mut || ...)
```

```
foo(|| ...)

fn foo<F:FnMut()>(f: F) { foo_(&mut f) }
fn foo_(f: &mut FnMut()) { }
```

```
|| --> currently expands to a struct that implement Fn, FnMut, FnOnce
could as easily expand to a ref based on expected type
```

```
fn foo(f: &mut FnMut()) { ... }
foo(|| ...) // would expand to match the signature
```

```
let c = || { };
```

```
// alex's example
fn foo<F: FnMut()>(o: Option<F>) {}
fn bar(o: Option<&mut FnMut()>) {}

fn main() {
    // foo(None); // will not compile
    bar(None);
    foo(Some(|&mut:| {}));
    bar(Some(&mut || {})); // will lose the leading &mut
}

```

- General consensus: this would address a common pain point
- Draw up a small RFC

# Servo update

- jack: OS X cross compile to any target are broken. Does @alexcrichton have a bug open?
- acrichto: nope. File a rust bug.
- jack: nmatsakis was interested in the problems we had during the rust upgrade to 1.0 alpha. I can send you a link to the PR.
