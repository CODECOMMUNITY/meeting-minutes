# 1.0 Status report

What is the status of the 1.0 release?

Done with fast-forwarding beta to master; all cherry picking from here on.

Doc fixes continue to come in for APIs. In the future, we probably
won't cherry pick these. But for 1.0, we want to. (Currently bare doc
URLs go to nightly docs, but this may change, and people coming in
from homepage could end up on stable docs regardless).

A few nominated 1.0 PRs already, plus some anticipated ones:
- brson has fixes for packaging
- Sync bound on Error
- Reflect/downcasting for Error (no PR yet, waiting for Niko)
- Felix may have a few

# 1.1 planning

Given the 1.0 status, it's time to start focusing on 1.1 beta. Several
RFCs have already been merged, others are near consensus, e.g.:

- Socket timeouts ([RFC 1047])
- Extend with Clone ([RFC 839])
- Duration ([RFC 1040])
- std::fs ([RFC 1044])

Need to communicate this shift in focus to broader community.

# RFC discussion

Discussed:

- Governance RFC ([RFC 1068]). Surprisingly little discussion here. All
  existing comments have been responded to.

- mem::forget ([RFC 1066]). *Lots* of discussion happening on thread,
  including proposals for sweeping changes to `Rc`, and concerns about
  the status of RAII. Most points raised have been responded to, and
  it seems clear that the RFC (which just recognizes the status quo)
  is the only option for 1.0. Other avenues, like `Leak`, can be
  explored later on.

- Reserve async/await keywords ([RFC 1083]). Suggests reserving `async`
  and `await`, but we have previously determined that we will need
  some way to add un-reserved keywords without breakage (either
  contextually, or by a crate-level opt-in). RFC should be closed with
  an explanation of the policy. We should probably have a FAQ for this
  kind of thing.

# Minuting

After requests on the governance RFC, we decided to go ahead and
publish meeting minutes/summaries like this one, regardless of any
other governance changes.
